# Hand Motion Controlled Robotic Vehicle

## Aim 
This project aims to make a hand motion controlled robotic vehicle which will be helpful especially for disabled people as it allows hand motion to move the vehicle in forward, backward, left or right direction. So the user does not have to press any buttons

## Working Principle:
The system has a receiver circuit designed which will be mounted on a top of a glove which the user has to wear. The circuit on the vehicle includes RF receiver, 8051 microcontroller and Driver IC to operate the motors.
The receiver circuit that is on the top of a glove includes Atmega microcontroller interfaced to the accelerometer. The commands that are detected by the IC on this circuit are sent to the RF transmitter which then forwards the commands to the RF receiver. The RF receiver then sends the commands to 8051 microcontroller which processes the commands so that the vehicle moves in the specified direction.
