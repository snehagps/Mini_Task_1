# Circuit Breaker Based On Password
## Aim:
Aim of this project is to make a password based circuit breaker system. Here we connect the circuit with a keypad through which we enter the password. There is a substantial increase in the number of fatal accidents involving line men due to electric shocks resulting from the lack of coordination between maintenance staff and the electric substation staff.

## Working Principle:
Here the control of the circuit is provided at the substation. A circuit breaker is used along with a keypad. The line man can enter the password to switch OFF the circuit.
He may now safely work out the repairs and may return to the substation to switch ON the circuit.
He again needs to enter the password in order to switch ON the circuit.
Since the control to switch ON/OFF the circuit lies with the lineman himself there is no chance of accidents. The system uses an 8051 microcontroller in order to tally password and a matrix keypad to take password input.
The system may be later enhanced by integrating with an EEPROM for password changing as and when needed.
