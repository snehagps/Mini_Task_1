# Power generation using speed breakers
# Description :
A large amount of electricity is wasted at the speed breakers through friction , everytime a vehicle passes through it. So electricity can be generated using vehicle weight as input .The aim of this project is to create one such model using either spring-coil mechanism or rack-pinion mechanism. This is a Low Budget electricity production which is suitable at parking of multiplexes, malls, toll booths, signals, etc. The disadvantage is that we have to check mechanism from time to time ,it can get rusted in rainy season .
