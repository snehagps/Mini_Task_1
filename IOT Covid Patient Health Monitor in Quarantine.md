# IOT Covid Patient Health Monitor in Quarantine

# Aim :
With the increasing number of COVID cases it is becoming difficult to keep a track on the health conditions of  many quarantined patients.\n
The problems here are: 
Doctors need to regularly monitor patient health ,There are increasing number of patients for the doctors to monitor,The doctors are at risk of infection just for monitoring purpose
So this project aims to make a IOT Covid Patient Health Monitor in Quarantine to solve this problem
 
# Working Principle:
This remote IOT  based health monitor system that allows for remotely monitoring of multiple covid patients over the internet.
The system monitors patient heartbeat, temperature and blood pressure using a heartbeat sensor, temperature sensor and BP Sensor respectively.
The system then transmits this data over the internet using wifi transmission by connecting to wifi internet connection. The data is transmitted and received over IOT-by-IOT platform to display data of patient remotely. The entire system is run by a microcontroller based circuitry. If any anomaly is detected in patient health or if the patient presses the emergency help button on IOT device, an alert is sent over IOT remotely. The system is mounted at patient bedside and constantly transmits patient health data over the internet so that doctors can monitor multiple patients remotely and attend the desired patient urgently when needed.
