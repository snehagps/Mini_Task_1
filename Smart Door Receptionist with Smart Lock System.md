# Smart Door Receptionist with Smart Lock System
## Aim:
This project aims to  make a Smart Receptionist with smart lock system .This is mainly designed and developed for security system and purposes. 
## Working Principle:
This smart security system is used to see a visitor when the main door of the office or organization is closed. The purpose of this system is to control the door lock using IOT ,Raspberry Pi. <br />
In this system whenever a person rings the bell, image of the person is captured by the camera and then the smart lock system will send the image to a particular website. Once the image is uploaded on the website, an option will be available of either unlocking the door or keeping the door locked. If the person accepts the permission to enter, then the system will open the door, and if the person denies the permission to open the door, door will remain locked and the system will display as well as speak out a message as “Access Denied”.
