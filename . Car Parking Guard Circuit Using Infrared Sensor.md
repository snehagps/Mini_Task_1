# Car Parking Guard Circuit Using Infrared Sensor

This project aims to help the car driver by giving an alarm if there is any obstacle or a wall while parking or driving in reverse. We use IR Sensor to detect an obstacle within 100cm range. If there is an obstacle it produces sound by generating a buzzer sound by PWM using LM555 timer operating in astable multivibrator mode. Tone Detector LM567 is used to set the cut-off frequency to sound the buzzer after the cut-off frequency reaches. Every car have reverse indicator supply which can be given to the 7805 Voltage Regulator to give 5volt for circuit to start functioning.
